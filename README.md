## Introduction
Hello! My name is Asif. I have a background in mechanical engineering and I am studying Data Science. 
My prior experience is in mechanical design, technical support, operations, maintenance and project management.

As and when I conduct any data science related work/study/projects, I will share them here. Please feel free to look around!

## Projects
Here I will provide a brief introduction of each individual project. Please click on the respective links to see the code and analyis.

### Analyzing wealth of the richest people
**File (ipynb):** [`RichPeople.ipynb`](https://github.com/AJMech/Projects/blob/main/RichPeople.ipynb)

**Objective:** Analyze the wealth of richest people

**Description:** Analysis of dataset was conducted for practice and educational purposes. Data was obtained from Kaggle (thanks to divanshu22). Link to data is available in the ipynb file. Original dataset has more than two thousand and seven hunderd lines of data and five columns. It shows names of people, their country, organization and net worth. I have extracted different information from the data set and have added explanation of each line of code for ease of understaing for anyone who would like to learn from my work. Have fun!

**Skills:** Data cleaning, analysis and visualization using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Analyzing global median age growth
**File (ipynb):** [`MedianAge.ipynb`](https://github.com/AJMech/Projects/blob/main/MedianAge.ipynb)

**Objective:** Analyze the median age growth or decline in various countries and continents

**Description:** Global median age data was scraped from Wikipedia using Python code. Link to data is available in the ipynb file. Scrapped data contains median age of all the countries and regions from 1950 to 2020. I have extracted different information from the data set and have added explanation of each line of code for anyone to see and learn from my work. Enjoy!

**Skills:** Data cleaning, analysis and visualization using Python, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
